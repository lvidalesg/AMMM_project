# AMMM Project - Greedy Solver

This part of the project handles solving instances of the camera coverage problem using a **Greedy Set Cover algorithm** in Python. It also includes a script to transform instances from the optimization format into a Python-readable format.

## Overview

1. **Input Instances**: originally generated by the Instance Generator in **optimization format** (`.dat` files).  
2. **Transformation**: `load_data_python.py` converts these `.dat` files into Python readable datafiles that can be used by the greedy algorithm.  
3. **Greedy Algorithm**: selects a subset of cameras covering all crossings (nodes) while minimizing the total weekly cost.
4. **Solution Output**: the solution is saved in the same folder as the Greedy Algorithm script, with the same base name of `.dat` file and extension `.greedy.sol`.

## How to run
```
from greedy import main

# Execute greedy algorithm on the given instance
main("datafile.dat")
```

## How the Greedy Algorithm Works

1. **Candidate Generation**:  
   The algorithm first computes all possible camera placements and their coverage patterns using `compute_coverages()`. Each candidate has:
   - A crossing location
   - A camera model/type
   - A weekly on/off pattern
   - A cost

2. **Greedy Selection**:  
   The algorithm iteratively selects the candidate that covers the most uncovered nodes per unit cost. It continues until all nodes are covered or no candidate can improve coverage.

3. **Feasibility Check**:  
   - If all nodes are covered, the algorithm returns a feasible solution with the selected cameras and total weekly cost.  
   - If it's impossible to cover all nodes with the given candidates, the algorithm returns `INFEASIBLE`.
